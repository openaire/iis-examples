/**Here the namespace is different from other definitions of Avro schemas. 
 * This is because we're using a record called "Document" and a record
 * with this name is already defined by "Document.avdl" file in the 
 * "eu.dnetlib.iis.core.examples.schemas.documentandauthor" namespace.
 *
 * The main goal of this schema is to show that using records with the same
 * name but different schema is possible. However, because both types of the
 * "Document" records are used in more-or-less same places, in practice it
 * would be probably tedious to have records with the same name but in 
 * different namespaces. In such case, a probably better idea would be to
 * store them in the same namespace, but change the name of one of them.
