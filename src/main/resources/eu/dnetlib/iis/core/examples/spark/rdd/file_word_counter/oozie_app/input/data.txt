Let me be frank with Thee, O Krishna, because Thou art the indweller of my heart, the
witness of my mind, and the Lord of my life-breath! I cannot hide anything from Thee, because
Thou directly witnesseth all the thoughts that emanate from my mind. I have no fear of Thee. Thou
art my friend now. Treat me like Arjuna. I shall sing and dance. You can play on the flute. Let us eat
sugar-candy and butter together. Let us sing. Teach me the
Gita.
Let me hear it directly from Thy
lips once more.
O Thou invisible One! O adorable and Supreme One! Thou penetratest and permeatest this
vast universe from the unlimited space down to the tiny blade of grass at my feet. Thou art the basis
of all names and forms. Thou art the apple of my eye, the divine love of my heart, the life of my life,
the very soul of my soul, the illuminator of my intellect and senses, the sweet mystic music of my
heart, and the substance of my physical, mental and causal bodies.
I recognise Thee alone as the mighty ruler of this universe and the inner controller of my
three bodies. I prostrate again and again before Thee, my Lord. Thou art my sole refuge. I trust Thee
alone, O ocean of mercy and love! Elevate, enlighten, guide and protect me. Remove the obstacles
on my spiritual path. Remove the veil of ignorance.
O Thou supreme world-teacher! I cannot bear any longer, even for a second, the miseries of
this physical body, this life and this worldly existence. Meet me quickly, O Prabhu! I am pining, I
am melting. Listen, listen, listen to my fervent, innermost prayer. Do not be cruel, my Lord. Thou
art the friend of the afflicted. Thou art one who raises the downtrodden. Thou art the purifier of the
fallen
